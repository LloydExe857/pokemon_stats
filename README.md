# Overview

This program does some basic analysis of a dataset of over 700 Pokemon and their in-game-stats. I did not create this dataset, but found it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon). I did alter the data to include stat totals and to clean up the names for alternate forms of Pokemon

I wrote this program to help me better understand the concepts of data analysis and usage of pandas.

If you want a little demo, watch this video!

# Data Analysis Results

This programs allows you to compare every stat (including stat totals) for every Pokemon in the data in three ways:

* Finding the average (i.e., the average stat total for all included Pokemon is 435)

* Finding the Pokmon with the highest given stat (Deoxys (Speed Forme) has the highest speed, with a speed stat of 180)


* Finding the Pokemon with the lowest given stat (Happiny and Chansey are tied for an attack of 5)

# Development Environment

* VS Code
* Python 3.9.9 64-bit

# Future Work

In coming up with ideas for this project, I had more ideas that I was not able to successfully implement as of yet. Hopefully, I will be able to do so in the near future. These include ways to:
* Search for specific Pokemon and disply their stats
* Create a team of six Pokemon and calculate their type weaknesses and resistances
* Save those teams to a seperate file
